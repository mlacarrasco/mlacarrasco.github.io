I'm an Information Techonology Engineer and I hold a Master's degree in Computer Engineering, approved with highest distinction from the <a href="https://informatica.usach.cl/">University of Santiago de Chile </a> in 2004. I'm obtained a doctorate in Engineering Sciences, with a mention in Computing, from the <a href="https://dcc.ing.uc.cl/">Department of Computer Science</a> at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and a Doctorate in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.isir.upmc.fr/">Institut des Systemes Intelligents et de Robotique  (ISIR)</a> at the <a href="https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/en/sorbonne-universite-campus-pierre-et-marie-curie">Pierre et Marie Curie University - Paris VI (France)</a>, both degrees obtained with highest distinction in 2010. I'm  particularly interested in the development of automatic algorithms based on image processing theory and computer vision. My main research topics are: i) image processing, ii) computer vision for industrial inspection, iii) Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and iv) fault prediction based on pattern recognition.

Currently, I'm an Associate Professor of the <a href="http://eit.udp.cl">School of Information and Telecommunication Engineering </a> at the <a href="https://ingenieriayciencias.udp.cl/">Faculty of Engineering and Sciences </a> at <a href="https://www.udp.cl">Universidad Diego Portales (UDP)</a>, Chile
