I'm an Information Techonology Engineer and I hold a Master's degree in Computer Engineering, approved with highest distinction from the <a href="https://informatica.usach.cl/">University of Santiago de Chile </a> in 2004. I'm obtained a doctorate in Engineering Sciences, with a mention in Computing, from the <a href="https://dcc.ing.uc.cl/">Department of Computer Science</a> at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and a Doctorate in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.isir.upmc.fr/">Institut des Systemes Intelligents et de Robotique  (ISIR)</a> at the <a href="https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/en/sorbonne-universite-campus-pierre-et-marie-curie">Pierre et Marie Curie University - Paris VI (France)</a>, both degrees obtained with highest distinction in 2010 thanks to a co-tutorship scholarship from the Franco-Chilean Doctoral College granted by the Council of Rectors of Chilean Universities (CRUCH) and the French Embassy. 

I'm  particularly interested in the development of automatic algorithms based on image processing theory and computer vision. My main research topics are: i) image processing, ii) computer vision for industrial inspection, iii) Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and iv) fault prediction based on pattern recognition.
