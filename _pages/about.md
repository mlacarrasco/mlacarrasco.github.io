I earned my Ph.D. in Informatics with highest honors from <a href="https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/en/sorbonne-universite-campus-pierre-et-marie-curie">Pierre et Marie Curie University</a> (Sorbonne University) at the Institut des Systèmes Intelligents et de Robotique <a href="https://www.isir.upmc.fr/">Institut des Systemes Intelligents et de Robotique (ISIR)</a> in 2010. I also hold a Ph.D. in Engineering Sciences in Computer Science from Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, completed under a jointly supervised doctoral program for which I received a scholarship from the Collège Doctoral Franco-Chilien in 2007, and a Master's degree in Computer Engineering, approved with highest distinction from the <a href="https://informatica.usach.cl/">University of Santiago de Chile</a> in 2004. In 2013, I was awarded a research mobility fellowship funded by the French Government to work at the Institut de la Vision in Paris on a large-scale project aimed at restoring vision to blind individuals. My research focuses on image processing, industrial applications, and human-computer interaction.

Beyond my research contributions, I am deeply committed to education and student mentorship at both undergraduate and graduate levels. My excellence in teaching has been recognized through multiple awards: Best Professor of the Faculty of Engineering at Universidad Diego Portales (UDP) in 2010 and 2013, Best Professor of the School of Informatics and Telecommunications in 2011 and 2013, and Best Professor of the Master's Program in Data Science in 2021, 2023, and 2024. I have participated in effective learning workshops at Harvard University through the LASPAU exchange program and hold international certification as an International Engineering Educator (ING.PAED.IGIP) from the <a href="https://igip.org/">International Society for Engineering Pedagogy</a>.

Currently, I am a Professor in the <a href="http://eit.udp.cl">School of Information and Telecommunication Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://ingenieriayciencias.udp.cl/">Faculty of Engineering and Sciences</a>, <a href="https://www.udp.cl">Universidad Diego Portales (UDP)</a>, Chile. My research focuses on four main areas: image processing, computer vision for industrial inspection, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and fault prediction based on pattern recognition.
