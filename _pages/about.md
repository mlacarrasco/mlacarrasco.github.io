Miguel Carrasco is an Information System Engineere and holds a Master's degree in Computer Engineering, approved with highest distinction from the University of Santiago de Chile in 2004. He obtained his doctorate in Engineering Sciences, with a mention in Computing, from the Department of Computer Science at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and a Doctorate in Computer Science from the Institut des Systèmes Intelligents et de Robotique (ISIR) at the Pierre et Marie Curie University - Paris VI (France), both degrees obtained with highest distinction in 2010 thanks to a co-tutorship scholarship from the Franco-Chilean Doctoral College granted by the Council of Rectors of Chilean Universities (CRUCH) and the French Embassy. He is particularly interested in the development of automatic algorithms based on image processing theory and computer vision. His main research topics are: i) image processing, ii) computer vision for industrial inspection, iii) Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and iv) fault prediction based on pattern recognition.

He has completed postdoctoral internships at the Institut de la Vision (Paris) and research stays at the Institut de Biologie Structurale (IBS, Grenoble), the Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique (CEA, Paris), the Faculty of Arts (U. Granada), the Faculty of Education Sciences and Psychology (U. Córdoba), and the Department of Computer Sciences (U. São Paulo, Brazil). He is an expert in computer vision techniques and applications. He has extensive experience in software and hardware development, where he has implemented image processing, machine learning, deep learning, and embedded programming algorithms over the past 15 years. Among the main results of his projects are more than 30 WoS articles and more than 20 papers in international and national conferences. Currently, he leads the development of an optical measurement system for a mining industry instrument, which is in the patenting phase. He has been the principal investigator of a FONDECYT initiation grant (No. 11100098) and co-investigator in various national and international projects, including a STIC-AmSUD, European Union Horizon 2020, and several regional FONDEF and FIC projects in the role of co-director and associated researcher. He is currently an Associate Professor in the Faculty of Engineering and Sciences at Adolfo Ibáñez University (UAI), Chile.

His main work as an academic has focused on training professionals of excellence. This has led him to obtain an International Engineering Educator Certification (ING.PAED.IGIP) from the International Society for Engineering Pedagogy (Austria) in 2023. This certification has been an invitation to reflect on teaching work, where values, ethics, rigor, and professionalism play a fundamental role in how future professionals will interact in their professional lives. In this sense, one of his main focuses has been the attitude and predisposition of students in order to generate a real long-term impact. In view of his commitment to teaching, he has obtained different awards such as the best teacher in undergraduate and postgraduate programs along with the teaching leadership award throughout his work as an academic.
