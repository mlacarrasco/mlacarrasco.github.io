Role: Researcher,Developer. 

This project aims to develop a machine to evaluate the quality of wine glass bottles. My research consists in generating a robust multiple view inspection scheme in a non-calibrated way. The main motivation is the development of new computer vision techniques that may be applied as quality control methods to different manufactured products. Project partially supported by CONICYT ACT-32 and the School of Engineering at Pontiﬁcia Universidad Católica de Chile.
