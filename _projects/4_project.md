Cone Penetration Test (CPT) probes allow for the analysis and determination of soil properties through a probe that penetrates the soil up to 30 meters deep or more. Current systems do not allow for visual identification of soil stratigraphy, study of erosion problems, and soil liquefaction. The challenge is to create a probe cone with high-strength glass containing a miniature high-definition camera inside. It must be capable of withstanding forces of up to 22 tons and reach depths of at least 30m.
