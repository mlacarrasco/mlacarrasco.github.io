FONDECYT-CONICYT (Initiation into research competition) (2011-2013).
Role: Principal Researcher. 

This project proposes a novel approach to detect reach-to-grasp movements by means of computer vision techniques. My solution fuses two viewpoints, the first of which is obtained from an eye-tracker device capturing the user's head perspective and the second viewpoint is captured by a wearable camera attached to the user's wrist. 

Project supported by CONICYT under grant no. 11100098
